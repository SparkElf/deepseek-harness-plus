# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness is an all-plugin Cordis agent harness. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for documentation.

## Pre-release stance: foundation over blast radius

**Remove at the first tagged release.** Until then, prefer foundations to compatibility shims: rename freely and update every reference. Backends reject old formats. SQLite uses monotonic `SCHEMA_VERSION`; `dsh-session` keeps `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` at `0` without compatibility promises.

**Application launch.** Only `dsh` profiles launch supported Node apps; package bins, demos, and public SDK argv escapes are forbidden ([rule](docs/architecture.md#application-launch)).

**Security and defensive design are opt-in.** Do not introduce either without explicit user authorization for the current task; this rule overrides default hardening guidance.

### Host sandbox failures

Retry a required command with the narrowest host escalation only after proving the sandbox blocked credentials, network, IPC, watching, or nested `sandbox-exec`. Never bypass product or test failures.

### Run relevant checks locally

Use [dsh-pre-push-checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md) before pushes. Validate immediately after `gh stack sync`; merge only after checks pass.

- Match evidence to the surface: focused behavior tests, model/user-output snapshots, `doc-sync` for docs, built smokes for published paths, and real-API e2e for providers.
- Treat an unexpectedly long test as a possible failure: identify the blocked phase and fix the cause instead of accepting the runtime as merely slow.
- Do not repeat passing checks for commit or push. Run the full local suite only by request, for CI diagnosis, or for irreducibly repository-wide changes; CI owns exhaustive coverage and the platform matrix.
- `test:coverage`, not `test`, is the CI coverage gate ([why](docs/testing.md)).

## Secrets / .env

Real-API tests and demos read `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, and root `.env`. cordis.yml allows `!!js` (never `!js`) under plugin `config` and entry `disabled`; other metadata stays literal, so conditional composition also uses overlays ([primer](docs/cordis-primer.md#loader-configuration)). Never commit credentials. CI e2e skips without a key; [testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns key policy.

## Conventions

- Every npm package is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<name>`; vendored packages are rescoped ([mapping](docs/rescope.md)) and `private: true`. `@deepseek-ai/cordis` is a peerDependency (+ dev) of every harness package.
- ESM everywhere (`"type": "module"`). Use package names across packages and `.ts` in local relative imports. Config subprocesses run built `lib/` under plain Node; source regressions use their declared launcher ([testing policy](docs/testing.md#test-subprocess-launch-modes)). The `dsh` CLI source launch runs through tsx's ESM-only hook (`node --import tsx/esm`); modules it reaches must stay ESM (no CJS-only exports) — Node's native TypeScript modes are unavailable across the engines range ([source-launch contract](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-dsh-source-launch-tsx-esm.md)). Raw/Web `cordis.yml` bare plugins must appear in their resolver manifest's `dependencies`; `verify-cordis-config` enforces it.
- **Registrations are effects**: every contribution goes through `ctx.effect()` / `ctx.on()`; a registry's `register()` returns the disposer.
- **Runtime invariants assert owned relationships.** Check authoritative event streams or mutable data, not service or method presence, plugin metadata or effects, or fixed pure examples. Without a plausible relationship, an explained empty companion is correct ([package invariant rules](packages/AGENTS.md)).
- **Typed events use declaration merging** and merge-extensible maps. Event JSDoc needs `@mode` and payload `@param`; scoped keys absent from payloads need `@dshScopeScan unsupported`. Public service methods document parameters and non-void returns. `SessionEventMap` members are required-on-read by default — builds that do not know a type refuse the log unless the event carries the envelope's `ignorable: true`; only structural format changes bump `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` ([mechanism](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-10-session-log-version-mechanism.md)).
- **Switch on discriminant tags.** Closed unions end in `assertNever`; merge-extensible unions fall through a documented default.
- **Waterfall listeners MUST call `next()`** to delegate; returning without it short-circuits the chain ([semantics](docs/cordis-primer.md#cordis-waterfall-semantics)).
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged**: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the session log; a new model-visible input requires a session event.
- **Plugins, not loop changes**: new behavior goes on documented extension points; changing `agent-loop` requires updating docs/architecture.md.
- **A capability seam comprises Service Definition / Service Provider / Consumer roles.** It is complete, never one role; split only when roles evolve independently ([glossary](docs/glossary.md#capability-seam)).
- **Prefer maintained dependencies over hand-rolling** when they genuinely delete owned code and tests ([policy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-dependencies-over-hand-rolling.md)).
- **Explicit > implicit at package boundaries**: defaulting is an explicit `resolve(request): Spec` step in the owning implementation, never a hidden `?? default` inside `run()` (the `dsh-shell` request/spec split is the template).
- **No hardcoded tunables in plugins**: deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields changeable from cordis.yml; a `DEFAULT_*` constant or test hook is not configurability. Protocol constants, external specs, and security invariants stay fixed.
- **One authorization principal inside one declared trust domain.** When a platform declares managed DSH trusted, forward that platform's current JWT and enforce role/resource permissions at the platform API; do not add path/scope filters, derived credentials, or replicated permission policy unless an approved threat model defines a distinct trust domain. Credential expiry may reject a new platform operation but never owns an accepted Agent turn, observation stream, or runtime-container lifecycle ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-01-managed-integration-single-authorization-principal.md)).
- **Misconfiguration fails loud** at load when self-contained, otherwise at the earliest resolvable point; never silently skip a missing referent.
- **Opaque cross-boundary ids are branded** (`Branded<B>` from `dsh-brand`), never bare `string`.
- **Trust TypeScript at typed same-process boundaries.** Do not add runtime validation, fallback behavior, or hostile-input tests solely for values the static interface requires; validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries.
- **Source plane vs artifact plane, never mixed.** Static gates and tests resolve workspace imports through tsconfig `paths` to `src` and pass on a clean tree; gates consuming built `lib/` declare that dependency ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Keep compiler faces explicit.** A package with both Host and Client programs exposes face-specific leaf configs and a solution-only root; repo-wide programs seed a face config, never the root solution ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **An empty `catch` names what it swallows** and why nothing else can reach it; keep the `try` to one statement.
- **Keep comments local.** Do not restate code, explain distant behavior unless locally required, or expand unrelated comments ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-09-concrete-prose-names-actors-and-recorded-facts.md)).
- **Prefer symmetry for parallel values**; unexplained asymmetry usually signals a missed extraction.
- **Tests describe behavior, not correctness.** Change obsolete behavior with its tests; explain why in the PR.
- **Non-trivial changes MUST include an Agent Note in the same PR;** only mechanical/local edits are exempt ([scope](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)). Archived notes are frozen: never edit or treat them as current authority ([archive policy](.agents/notes/README.md#archiving-and-deletion)).
- **Client UI copy is locale-owned.** Route product text through typed dictionaries and `t` or localized primitive props; `verify-client-ui-i18n` rejects hardcoded copy ([decision](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-23-locale-owned-client-ui-copy.md)).
- **Testing policy** — [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). Every non-trivial model- or product-user-visible change updates a keyless recorded-session snapshot; [snapshot ownership](snapshots/AGENTS.md) reserves the top-level tree for session-driven cases and keeps other expected output owner-local. Fixtures replay on macOS/Linux; fix fixtures, not normalizers.
- **Design each tool's UI presentation up front.** Host presenters stay pure; Web cards derive from raw events and persisted result metadata ([cookbook](docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md)).
- **Plan unit, e2e, and snapshot coverage** for capability seams, lifecycle paths, and transcript output; include missing snapshot-harness support in the same change.
- **Both SDKs project the loop.** Agent-loop, session-lifecycle, and `SessionEventMap` changes update the TypeScript and Python SDK expected outputs in the same PR; `pnpm run test` covers neither ([surfaces](docs/testing.md#when-a-snapshot-test-is-required)).
- **Choose PR history deliberately.** Split independent changes and fix the introducing PR before propagation. Standalone/stack branches may merge-forward or rebase. Rewrites use `--force-with-lease`, abort on remote movement, never raw `--force`; preserve an in-progress merge-forward checkpoint before taking a newer base ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-02-native-github-stacks-and-optional-rebases.md)).
- **Labels:** one PR `kind/*`, all material `area/*`, and native Issue Type ([taxonomy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-08-unified-github-label-taxonomy.md)).
- TODO markers: `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` by urgency ([semantics](docs/development.md)).
- Files end with exactly one trailing newline; `git diff --cached --check` (pre-commit) gates it.

## Defensive patterns

Read [docs/defensive-patterns.md](docs/defensive-patterns.md) before lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, or teardown work.

## Type safety and documentation

Everything compiles under `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`; every remaining `any` explains why narrowing is infeasible. Every module and export has concise JSDoc for its non-obvious contract; function-like exports include `@param`/`@returns`, as enforced by `verify-export-jsdoc`. Heritage-declared members, plugin-protocol slots, and constructors keep their docs at the declaring Service Definition, protocol, or class.

Comments and docs state complete contracts and context, not reasoning transcripts. Use direct, concrete terms. Do not use metaphors. Before writing `contract`, `boundary`, or `shape`, ask whether a more exact term names the subject: write `response fields`, `JSON validation`, or `ESM exports` instead of `response shape`, `validation boundary`, or `module shape`. Keep `contract` for preconditions, postconditions, invariants, compatibility promises, and other obligations that callers, callees, implementers, providers, producers, or consumers rely on. Keep a literal process, wire, security, transaction, or lifecycle boundary. Do not narrate control flow or tests, preserve review history, or restate code. Keep behavior, failure, timing, ownership, and safe-use facts; link the rationale. Use [dsh-prose-standard](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md) for decisions. Wire mechanically checkable invariants into an executed top-level gate and prove each changed acceptance path rejects an invalid case. Use narrow, justified exceptions instead of disabling a rule globally.

Docs accompany every code change: update affected README and JSDoc contracts together. Routine bilingual work follows [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md); only explicit user invocation may run `dsh-translate-docs`. Current-state prose, one physical line per paragraph, one home per fact, and word budgets live there.

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks `AGENTS.md` at root and `packages/`; edit the real file. Keep each rule self-contained while linking high-level docs. Condense when clarity survives; raise a `verify-doc-budgets` ceiling when the required content genuinely needs more space.

## Vendoring policy

`vendor/` packages are pinned source copies (manifest with upstream SHAs in [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md)). Update via the sync procedure there; re-apply or retire the logged local modifications; rerun `pnpm run test && pnpm run build`.

See [.agents/working-style.md](.agents/working-style.md): no sycophancy; report before implementing; decide plugin ownership before implementation.
